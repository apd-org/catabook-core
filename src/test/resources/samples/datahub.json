  "description": "This lab contains a set of experiments for evaluating the generation\r\ntime and space consumption of peer-action sequences. This is done by creating dummy sequences and measuring these two\r\nparameters. The data generated by this laboratory refers to a journal paper titled *Decentralized Enforcement of Document Lifecycle Constraints*, written by Sylvain Hall\u00e9, Rapha\u00ebl Khoury, Quentin Betti, Yli\u00e8s Falcone and Tony Hokayem.\r\n\r\nThis archive contains an instance of LabPal, an environment for running\r\nexperiments on a computer and collecting their results in a user-friendly way.\r\nThe author of this archive has set up a set of experiments, which typically involve running scripts on input data, processing their results and displaying them in tables and plots. LabPal is a library that wraps around these experiments and displays them in an easy-to-use web interface. The principle behind LabPal is that all the necessary code, libraries and input data should be bundled within a single self-contained JAR file, such that anyone can download and *easily* reproduce someone else's experiments. Detailed instructions can be found on the LabPal website, [https://liflab.github.io/labpal]",
